# Advent of Code 2021

That amazing time of the year where we all want to code a lot and if we do more than 2 exercises we are lucky.

## Day One

Pretty easy, will evaluate with my pair if it was better with a reduce rather than a filter |> count

## Day two

Was kinda easy too

## Day three

First part relatively easy, second part still on it, it's hard to conjure the algorithm functionally.
Second part was hardcore lol. This was interesting, want to come back at it. Possibility to refactor behaviour.
